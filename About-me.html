  <p class="intro">
    Hi!! I am Karnika, an undergraduate student. There are no lengthy paragraphs or bundle of sheets to describe myself. But to simply introduce myself I love cooking and eating (if you are a foodie like me then we are partners in business).
    I love travelling and listening to music. Art is a form of passion that I developed in the recent times. Apart from art I like debating and participating in conferences. Friends call me studious but frankly I am not. Love spending time with
    children and make myself happy by devoting sometime for them.

    <p class="art-journey">
      It all started when I got a call from a leading yoga fitness club. The CEO wanted me to do some artwork for one of their event in Goa, and I had done some portraits and given them on the theme 'Yoga binds everything' it was a great work by
      jamming of all creativity. It gave me a lot of confidence and made me realize that there is creativity and interest for art in me. That was the time when I got a call from CF. They were looking for some designers. Some of my work had
      impressed
      them and I was on boarded to their team as a junior designer. This is how my journey started. CF opened the door with a plethora of opportunities in front of me. Corporates from across service industries like hospitality, entertainment,
      financial services etc., came up with requirements. This gave me a very big exposure to work with corporates. My creativity and artwork was recognized and appreciated by a leading international financial service organization, in their event-
      ArtMag. My work was highly appreciated and well received. KCP provided me yet another challenge and made me to participate in the Pan India Panorama Art Fair. I was able to make it to the wall of Fame gallery which was a big recognition. The
      KCP committee recognized the creativity and provided a platform to display my talents.
      Art to me is where we make meaning beyond language. Art consists of making a meaning through intelligent agency, eliciting an aesthetic response. Reflecting the beauty of nature in various scenes through the brush strokes dipped in paint
      varies
      with the ideas and creativity of the artist and I am happy that I am able to convey itâ€™s beauty with my maximum satisfaction.
